# ETL-Project

## Overview
ETL-Project is a workspace for building and experimenting with Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflows. It is intended to collect data sources, transformation logic, and load targets in a single, organized repository.

## Repository Structure
- `app/`: Application code, scripts, and supporting resources for ETL tasks.

## Getting Started
1. Review the contents of the `app/` directory to understand existing ETL components.
2. Add new data sources, transformation steps, or load targets as needed.
3. Document any new workflows or dependencies in this README.

## Contributing
- Keep documentation up to date as new ETL steps are added.
- Prefer clear, descriptive names for scripts and configuration files.
